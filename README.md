# MTG Shuffle

***

### Why did you do this?

I have a pretty uniform style of shuffling my M:TG cards, because I tend to be very nervous about denting or bending a card, so I adopted a method of shuffling that is probably bad.
I wanted to quantify precisely how bad this method was, so I decided to recreate it in python to observe just how non-random my shuffling was. It's pretty bad. So I implemented random in order to at least simulate a degree of human absurdity.

### Should I use this shuffle?
I don't know, almost definitely not. Unless you want to use a shuffle algorithm that is faulty at best. In that case, this would be one of the better (see; more faulty) ones.

### Credits
Just me. Not a very demanding algorithm.
